## Installing / Getting started

This project uses node and npm.  To get started clone the repository and run the following commands. Note - a valid Ethos Integration api key needs to be added to the code for this to work.

```shell
npm install

npm run start
```
## Description

The course catalog demo is a simple React web app that makes api calls to Ethos Integration. The user is allowed to select from a list of academic periods and click the search button. The app will then make several api calls to build up a descriptive display of all the course sections that are available in that academic period.

## Notes about the code

A basic knowledge of React and/or web apps will be helpful understanding the code.
